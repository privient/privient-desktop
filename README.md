## Privient Data Client

Put the data back in your users hands.

Privient provides a dynamic solution to store users game or website data on their very own computer. The user may choose whether or not to allow a website to access his or her data.

Servers will make requests for data they want to retrieve or create new data for the user to store. The data cannot be modified by the client if the server adopts the recommended hashing model. See the RAGE examples in the orgnization.
